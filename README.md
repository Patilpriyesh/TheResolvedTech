Using machine learning we can implement two tasks on projects 1) Stock Price Predictions and  2) A simple chatbot assistance system using Python in jupyter notebook

1) Google Stock price prediction: 

The stock market plays a remarkable role in our daily lives. It is a significant factor in a country's GDP growth. In this model, I learned the stock market basics and how to perform stock price prediction using machine learning.

2) Simple chatbot assistance system:

we can build a simple Chatbot by using Python and Library nltk. A ChatBot is merely software by which humans can interact with each other.
Examples include Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft’s Cortana.
